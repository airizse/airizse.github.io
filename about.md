# My username's {{site.author}}, nice to meet you!

Ever since I saw my first anime on television when I was 5, drawing has been a part of me.
It has helped me made precious friends, kept my mind as healthy as it could and made me continuously improve myself.

I grew up since then, mostly in age and not vertically.
Although drawing plays a huge part in my life, I have many other points of interests, to name a few (unordered): photography, cooking and gaming. And that's just the peak of the iceberg.

# My idea behind this website
I stopped drawing happily for 2 years, which was one of the signs showing how unhealthy I was. I am fine now, but unsatisfied of the lack of progress I "missed". I believe that to improve my skills at anything, I need to be better at putting myself out there and discipline (lol).

So I made this space to organize myself (this idea was in my mind for 3 years already...). 
It's a laid back place in the internet where I can bundle up things such as humour, blog posts, and salt.

# The website right now...

is currently in construction! I am still templating it and learning what I can in the same time. *I want to make it as DRY as possible ( -nerds- will get me).* It's really fun!... But it takes some time. :)
